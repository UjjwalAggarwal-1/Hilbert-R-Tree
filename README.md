# Hilbert-R-Tree

A Hilbert function is a map from the *nonnegative integers* to themselves which records the lengths of composition series of each layer in a graded module.

A Hilbert function maps cartesian points (in the first quadrant) on a 2d vector plane to a point on the real line, or vice-versa. 

order of plane used in hilbert value function should be power of 2.
